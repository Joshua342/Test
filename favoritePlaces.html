                     Florida has many beautiful places to visit including their beaches. The water there is uncompariable to Mississippi water. Their water is 
                     beautiful blue with some white sandy beaches while Mississippi has muddy dark water.

                     Texas is also another place that is beautiful. Houston and Austin texas include many museums and live music concerts. Also can't forget their water.
                     Many states have prettier looking oceans compared to Mississippi.
