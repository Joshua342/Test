  <p> In my spare time I like to watch football and baseball. As most know the superbowl is going to happen soon between the rams and the bengals. I of course have the bengals winning but I think itll be a fun game to watch. Many of my friends are betting against me so it makes it even more exciting to watch.</p>
  <h3>Rams Information</h3>
  <div class="newspaper">The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team based in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The Rams compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The Rams play their home games at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which they share with the Los Angeles Chargers.

    The franchise began in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams, based in Cleveland, Ohio. The club was owned by Homer Marshman and featured players such as William "Bud" Cooper, Harry "The Horse" Mattos, Stan Pincura, and Mike Sebastian.[8] Damon "Buzz" Wetzel joined as general manager.[9] The franchise moved to Los Angeles in 1946 following the 1945 NFL Championship Game victory, making way for Paul Brown's Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference and becoming the only NFL championship team to play the following season in another city. The club played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving into a reconstructed Anaheim Stadium in Orange County, California in 1980. The Rams appeared in Super Bowl XIV, following the 1979 NFL season (their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history), where they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–19.
    
    The Rams left southern California and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, following the 1994 NFL season, becoming the St. Louis Rams. Five seasons after moving, the team won Super Bowl XXXIV in a 23–16 victory over the Tennessee Titans. The club then played in Super Bowl XXXVI, where they lost 20–17 to the New England Patriots. The Rams played in St. Louis until the end of the 2015 NFL season, when they filed notice with the NFL of their intent to move back to Los Angeles. The club's request was approved at an owners' meeting in January 2016, and the Rams returned to the city for the 2016 NFL season. The Rams appeared in Super Bowl LIII, where they lost to the New England Patriots 13–3 in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI.[10][11] Three years later, the Rams won the NFC title once again, appearing in Super Bowl LVI where they will face the Cincinnati Bengals.</div>
