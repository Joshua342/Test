  </header>
  <p>My name is <i>Joshua</i> and I was born and raised in <b>Hattiesburg, Mississippi.</b>
  I am 17 years old and a junior at Oak Grove Highschool. I would like to persue web development and python. At some point
  I would like to learn Java, C++, and C#. My goal by the end of this is to be able to create a nice looking website.</p>
